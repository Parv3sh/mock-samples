Welcome to Mockoon's mock API samples repository. You will find in the [`samples`](/samples) folder many mock samples from popular APIs (Open Weather, Giphy, etc.). We will be adding more samples from time to time.

## How to import the samples in Mockoon application

To import the samples in Mockoon application, you have two possibilities: 

1. Copy the sample file content from this repository to the clipboard and click in the application menu `Import/export -> Mockoon's format -> Import from clipboard`.
